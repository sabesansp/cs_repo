# Problem : Automate the test cases on CAT for nioc version 3 [450 min]

 # Goals :

  # nioc v3 test cases running in CAT
  # transfer to CPD after automation

 # Algorithm :
   
   # Terminology
    # Writing code for test cases (W)
    # Executing code for test cases (E)
    # Testcase - CAT integration (TC)
    # Cycle - W->E->C
    # U : unknown 

   # Write one simple testcase "ResourcePoolSmallVmnics"

    # Files
     # vdnet/automation/VDNetLib/TestData/TestbedSpecs/TestbedSpec.pm
      # add one more vds to "OneHostNIOCv3VDS"  
     # vdnet/automation/TDS/EsxServer/NetIORM/NetIOCv3Tds.pm

    # Negative test case, no understanding of how vdnet processes negative test cases
     # Is it worth spending time on this activity ?
     # No : Creation of negative test cases in automation framework is an external activity
     # Postponing this activity would be a better solution
     # Post a "TO_DO" comment in the TDS

   # W : One positive test case [tc_chosen = 'DefaultVMStarving'] 

    # Find a random test case that is not yet automated
     # Location : Inbox/Follow-up/action_items
     # Open up the document "NETIOCV3status-1.docx" 
     # document's location in computer : "~/Documents/nioc_v3_automation/NETIOCV3status-1.docx"
     # Update the current status for 'ResourcePoolSmallVmnics"
     # tc_chosen = 'DefaultVMStarving'

    # tc_understanding() [number_of_vms = 4]
     # Verify impact on a default vm with no SLR on the same host where there are VMs with SLR
     # 3 vms : vm.[1], vm.[2], vm.[3] => 1/3 of available bandwidth
     # SLR => Shares, Limits, Reservations
     # run_IO_Session(vms) || All the four vms
      # What does running IO session mean ?
      # One more test case that is automated might have IO session
      # tc = 'BasicScheduler'
