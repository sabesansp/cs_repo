P : Go through the python apis written by Shashank and replace the staf calls inside vdnet with these apis

[367mins]


# S1: Download the api mac timer to record the time taken to complete this activity
                 
                 
# S2: Write down a preliminary plan for completing this activity

 # Pick one api like "powerOff" 
 # Follow the same process as "powerOn" implemented by Prabuddh
 # Initial definition of process : code -> test -> review -> rework * {goes back to code}
                                   ------------------------> check-in 
 # api_1 -> code -> test -> review -> rework
         -> code -> test -> review -> rework
         -> code -> test -> review -> check-in
   [ a sample cycle which has two rework units based on comments ]
