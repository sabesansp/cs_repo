P : Go through the python apis written by Shashank and replace the staf calls inside vdnet with these apis

[55mins]


# S1: Download the api mac timer to record the time taken to complete this activity

# S2: Write down a preliminary plan for completing this activity

 # Pick one api like "powerOff" 
 # Follow the same process as "powerOn" implemented by Prabuddh
 # Initial definition of process : code -> test -> review -> rework * {goes back to code}
                                   ------------------------> check-in 
 # api_1 -> code -> test -> review -> rework
         -> code -> test -> review -> rework
         -> code -> test -> review -> check-in
   [ a sample cycle which has two rework units based on comments ]


# S3 :  To be able to implement the plan what would be required ? {"pre-req"}


 # File a bug for completing the task
  # bug_number = [#1374435]
  # link_bookmark() // bookmarks the link for the bug

 # Set up the vdnet code base on dbc
  # command  = "ssh ssaidapetpach@pa-dbc1109.eng.vmware.com" | password = "*"
  # n[files_modified] = 2
  # SP : Issue a command like "dbc-connect" from command line and connect to the place where repo is checked out
   #
  # SP :
